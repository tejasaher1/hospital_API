# hospital_API
We design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been allocated by the govt for testing and quarantine + well being of COVID-19 patients.

    • Doctor and Patient account creation: Functions for creating and registering doctor and patient account.
    • Doctor & Patient Authentication: Systems for secure doctor and user access, we authenticate doctor and Patient
    account’s using JWT passport authentication.
    • Patient Management: Functions for registering, updating, and managing patient records.
    • Medical History Tracking: API endpoints to track and manage patient medical histories.
    • Technologies Used: The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
